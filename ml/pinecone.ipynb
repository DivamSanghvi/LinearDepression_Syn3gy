The opaqueness is due to some solid precipitating out and I think it's calcium citrate. This makes sense because I used a little less sulfuric acid that needed, so some calcium citrate remained unreacted. I use less sulfuric acid than was needed to---make sure that all of it was consumed. Any unreacted sulfuric acid would be very hard to separate out whereas any unreacted calcium citrate can just be filtered off. Once the volume of that around a hundred milliliters I transferred to a smaller beaker. It was further boiled down until about 70 milliliters and then it was taken off the hot plate. I let it cool down to room temperature and then I transferred into a bowl to evaporate. To separate off the white powder it was pretty easy and I just filtered it through a coffee filter. Once everything is filtered through, I was left with a nice and clear citric acid solution. After letting it evaporate for about a day, we can see that some crystals have started to form. I then left it out for about a week and this is what I saw when I came back. I let it evaporate further for another week and then I transferred the crystals to a small beaker. In the bowl I'm left with a viscous brown goop and this can be discarded. The small amount of crystals that you see in the bowl here were also transferred to the beaker. All of the crystals were still wet so to dry them off I dumped them onto a piece of paper. On top I have printer paper but below I've paper towel to help absorb the liquid. I spread out the crystals and left it overnight and by morning they were pretty dry. When we zoom in on the larger chunk we can see that it's comprised of a lot of smaller crystals. The piece here is very fragile and once it's dry it's very easy to break apart. Just for fun now I'm going to take a closer look at the crystals. Using a crappy and cheap lens that I got a few years ago, I was able to get some decent shots. These are five crystals that I picked out and lined up and you can see that---three and two fully neutralize it we need to bring the solution up to a pH of about five. For the second most acidic proton we will need a pH around seven and for the least acidic one, we need to bring it up to about 8.5 or 9. Once we get a pH of about nine, almost a hundred percent of the citric acid should be neutralized. At the pH increases, the solubility of other things will decrease. This will cause a lot of them to precipitate out and as we continue to add sodium hydroxide more and more solid will form. I know I'm very close to a pH of about 8 or 9 when the addition of sodium hydroxide generates an orange color. I test the pH and I see that it's around 9. If the ph is a little bit higher than 9 it's probably still ok. Anyway what we have here is a solution of sodium citrate, with a lot of precipitate and pulp. We need to filter it off, but I don't really recommend using a vacuum filtration. The filter paper is very quickly blocked and liquid stops coming through. I found it was much more effective to just do a gravity filtration with some coffee filters. After here we'll also get blocked but I found it was a lot easier to deal with. Once it inevitably gets blocked I just take off the filter funnel and pour all of the liquid into a beaker. The clogged filter papers is then removed and I replace it with a fresh clean one. The liquid is then pour back in and the filtration continues. The filter paper is going to get blocked again and in total the process is repeated three or four times. It takes a couple hours but once I was done I transferred the filtrate to a beaker. The erlenmeyer flask was cleaned and then the liquid was filtered again.---\n"
